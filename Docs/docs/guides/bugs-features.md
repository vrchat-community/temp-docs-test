# Bugs and Feature Requests

The Creator Companion is part of a wave of updates that were revealed at the same time, and there are many parts that interact. We welcome Bug Reports and Feature Requests, but track them differently for Open-Source projects. This page describes where to file issues for the different components. This may change as the components develop, so it's a good idea to check this page for the latest information.
