## Summary

Fixes package sorting order and updates VRC Quick Launcher to 1.5.0

<!--truncate-->

## Changelog

* Parses string versions as SemVer so prerelease versions appear after release versions, and x.10 appears before x.9

## VRC Quick Launcher

* Added Local instance support
* Added an option to detect and launch a newly built local world
* Re-enabled Auto-layout and modified it to support EAC
* Improved the reliability of auto-layout and condensed the windows
* Removed Launch delay as this is no longer necessary in the post-EAC world (because of the launch times)
